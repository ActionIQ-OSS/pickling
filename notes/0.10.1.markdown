### Improvements

- Java UUID support. [#123][123] by [@mauhiz][@mauhiz]

### Fixes

- Fixes pickling of Java objects. See below 
- Fixes unpickling of sealed trait in `Array`. [#294][294] by [@jsuereth][@jsuereth]
- Fixes unpickling of `val` whose implementation accesses a field. [#328][328] by [@phaller][@phaller]

### Java Pickling workaround

Scala Pickling by default uses compile-time type information
to automatically generate a pickler for a given type.
For Java types, Pickling tries to guess the list of fields,
and it often guesses incorrectly. [#60][60], [#263][263]

Pickling 0.10.1 adds a workaround by stopping to
compile when it detects an empty pickler. [#295][295] by [@eed3si9n][@eed3si9n]
